# Android Dev Challenge Compose - Bloom App

![Workflow result](https://github.com/noelchew/android-dev-challenge-compose-week-4/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
Compose (& Compare!) Weather App is a practice project to learn Jetpack Compose.
The app uses OpenWeatherMap API through this library: [OpenWeatherMap-Android-Library](https://github.com/KwabenBerko/OpenWeatherMap-Android-Library)
The focus of this project is on building the UI, instead of the app architecture such as data repository with caching.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
I want to learn more about the new UI Toolkit Jetpack Compose.  
This app serves as a learning platform as well as a chance to explore Jetpack Compose.
